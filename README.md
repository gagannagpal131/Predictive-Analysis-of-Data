# Predictive-Analysis-of-Data
Predictive Analysis of data using R. (Machine Learning)

I have done predictive analysis of a sample dataset "attitude".I have divided the dataset into two parts:- test and train.The train dataset has been used to train the machine,i.e. perform machine learning.The test data set has been used to test the accuracy of the machine.I have used 4 machine learning techniques:- regression,neural networks,decision trees and random forest technique.

All these things have been encapsulated in a menu driven programme.Graphs showing the actual vs predicted data has been shown in each technique.
